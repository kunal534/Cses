## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to organizing and solving the CSES Problem Set in C++. It’s designed to be a clean, modular, and educational resource for anyone wanting to improve their problem-solving skills.

- Written entirely in **C++**
- Structured by problem categories (e.g., "Sorting and Searching", "Graph Algorithms", etc.)
- Scalable — easily add folders as you work through new topics
- Great resource for interview prep and self-learning

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kunal534/Cses.git
   cd Cses
   ```

2. **Run a specific solution**  
   Navigate to the corresponding folder and compile:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 problem_filename.cpp -O2 -o solution
   ./solution < input.txt
   ```

3. **Add your own solution**  
   - Place it in the appropriate category folder (e.g., `Dynamic_Programming`)
   - Name it clearly, like `minimizing_coins.cpp`
   - Include comments explaining the approach and complexity

## Spotlights on Problem Sections

- **Introduction Problems** — friendly challenges for warming up  
- **Sorting & Searching** — key techniques like two pointers, binary search  
- **Dynamic Programming** — patterns like knapsack, LIS, DP on trees  
- **Graph Algorithms** — BFS, DFS, shortest paths, spanning trees  
- **Advanced Techniques** — meet-in-the-middle, bitmasking, divide & conquer  
- **Interactive Problems** — practice I/O interaction logic with judges  
- **… and more** — kept modular for ease of navigation and contribution

## Contributing

Your help is welcome! Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Fork** the repository  
2. **Add or improve** solutions in existing categories  
3. **Create new folders** if you're solving a topic not yet covered  
4. **Submit a pull request**, describing your contribution

**Please make sure** each solution:
- Has a clear filename and folder  
- Includes comments explaining logic and complexity  
- Follows C++17 standards or later
